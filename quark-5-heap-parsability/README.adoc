= Shipilev's Quark #5: Heap Parsability

https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/5-tlabs-and-heap-parsability/

== To run

[source,shell script]
----
mvn clean package
mvn exec:exec
----

== Short recap

There are run 300 threads which each of them allocates one object.
This allocation means to get a TLAB space and for heap to be parsable
the rest of the TLAB is filled with an `int[]`.

The other thread just makes the OOM to happen which in combination with `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`
gives us the heap dump that we can https://www.eclipse.org/mat/[analyze].

[source,shell script]
----
./mat/MemoryAnalyzer java_pid50981.hprof
----

[NOTE]
====
----
An internal error occurred during: "Parsing heap dump from 'java_pid50981.hprof'".
Java heap space
----

change the `./mat/MemoryAnalyzer.ini` to use more memory with e.g. `-Xmx4g`
====

== On program arguments

There is used the Epsilon GC to be predictable and 1GB heap to fail with OOM soon.
