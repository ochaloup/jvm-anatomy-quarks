This will run the benchmark which allocates 50 millions of objects in a single thread.

For disabling the use of `TLAB` which makes the allocation slower as every request
goes through the JVM synchronization machinery (into the native method).
Even there is single thread, and no thread contention happens, this slows down allocation.
